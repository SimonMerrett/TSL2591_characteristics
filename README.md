# TSL2591_characteristics
Just some plot data taken from the datasheet so people can use it to make better Lux values and other calcs. I used the awesome https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/index.html which I commend to others who want to make datasheet plots into usable data series.

Here's an example graph made from the .csv data in the /data folder. It would be great to see a better Lux figure come out from having the CH0, CH1 and photometric curves now all quantified.
